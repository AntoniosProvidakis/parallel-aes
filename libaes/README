  libaes is a program distributed under the GPLv3 license,
it was created by Quentin Carbonneaux. A copy of the GPL must
be present in this package in the file COPYING.


- LIBAES

  libaes is a static library which provides basic AES encryption
(using the Rijndael algorithm). In order to use it in you project you
may include aes.h everywhere you need AES primitives then compile your
code with the file aes.c.

  You can also use the Makefile.lib provided. In order to do so,
create a directory in your project's path, for example libaes. Copy
aes.h aes.c tables.h Makefile.lib files (they are in a directory of
this archive named libaes) to this directory. Rename "Makefile.lib" to
"Makefile". Then, in every file you need libaes add this line

#include <aes.h>

To compile your code follow these steps :

1 - compile libaes using the make command in libaes directory, for
example add the following lines in your makefile :

libaes.a:
	cd pathtolibaes/libaes/ && make

2 - add libaes.a as a dependency of your binary program in your
makefile

3 - compile your source files using these gcc arguments (add the
libaes directory to your include path)

   cc -Ipathtolibaes/libaes/ your_arguments your_sources.c

4 - link your object files using these gcc arguments (add the libaes
directory to your libraries path and link with libaes).

   cc your_object_files -Lpathtolibaes/libaes/ -laes -o your_output_program

A good example for this method can be found in this package (see the
makefile of aescrypt).

  The behavior of the library can be tested by going into the libaes
directory and running "make check".

  For educative purposes a file named aestables_main.c is included in
the archive, it is the program that were used to genrate the
pre-computed tables that can be found in file tables.h.

For more informations on using libaes see aes.h (and aescrypt.c).
